# PHP Array Key Type Juggling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to array key type juggling.  When using keys that can be interpreted as both strings and integers, PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected array element overwrites.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a solution.

## Bug Description
The core issue lies in how PHP handles array keys that are strings that can be cast to integers. PHP will implicitly convert the string key to an integer key when accessing elements, resulting in the overwriting of data that may not be immediately apparent.

## Solution
The solution involves consistently using the intended data type for keys, ensuring the array functions are not affected by unexpected conversions.
