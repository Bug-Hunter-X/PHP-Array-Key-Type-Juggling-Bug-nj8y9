The best solution is to use consistent and unambiguous array keys. If you need to use string keys, avoid using those which can be coerced to integers:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = 10;
$myArray["string_1"] = 20; //Use explicit strings for better clarity
echo count($myArray); // Outputs 2

// Now let's access the elements
echo $myArray["string_1"]; //Outputs 20
echo $myArray["1"]; // Outputs 10 (Correct behavior)
?>
```

Alternatively, if you require numeric indexing, explicitly convert keys to integers to ensure consistent behavior and avoid unexpected implicit conversions during array access or manipulation.  This promotes code readability and prevents subtle bugs related to loose typing.
