This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's loose typing and the way it handles array keys.  The issue arises when using array keys that are not strictly numeric. Consider the following:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = 10;
$myArray[1] = 20;
echo count($myArray); // Outputs 2

// Now let's access the elements
echo $myArray[1]; // Outputs 20
echo $myArray["1"]; //Outputs 20 (Unexpected behavior)
?>
```

The unexpected behavior is that `$myArray["1"]` and `$myArray[1]` both refer to the *same* array element. PHP's loose typing converts the string key "1" to an integer key 1 during array access.  This can lead to unexpected overwrites and data loss if not carefully considered, especially when dealing with user inputs that might be interpreted as numeric strings.
